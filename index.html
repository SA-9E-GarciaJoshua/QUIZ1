			<td>Dogecoin is a crypto currency that was,according to investopedia, made in this year of November 23. This meme was first intended as nothing more than a joke but because of the popular doge meme that circulated the internet at that time it quickly exploded in price. Now, it's valued at 0.48 pesos (or 28.29 pesos) with expert cryptobros expecting it to continue it's rise in value.

			<td>What came first, Instagram or Hex? These two have some pretty similar logos to eachother but back to topic, HEX was a genuine attempt at making a crypto currency with it's entire motif being that the higher you risk (how long you hold onto the coin) the higher the reward (how much real money you get back). Today it's standing at a depressing $0.002992 (0.18 pesos) with no signs of making a comeback, it's all time high was in Nov 16, 2021 at $0.5561 (32.78 pesos)</td>

			<td>ShibaInu is the rival of Dogecoins. It's supporters call it the "DogeCoin killer" according to Investopedia as it's just dogecoins but a shibainu is the mascot. It was created in August 2012 and it's current price right now is $0.00002519 (0.0015 pesos) with it's all time high being $0.00008616 (50.79 pesos) in October 28,2021. It seems like this "DogeCoin killer" was unable to do it's one goal.</td>
